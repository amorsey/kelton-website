        <p>
          Until now Solar Streetlights have been available as a utilitarian
          solution and have forced designers to choose between form and
          function.

          <p>
            Kelton Energy has integrated the components required to support
            Grid Hybrid lighting into a singulaly elegant design blending the
            Solar Panel, Led Light Engine and Battery System into a form worth
            of display in the most distinctive of communities. The patented
            linear, minimal wind loading bifacial cell array sets this
            structure apart from any existing solar lighting solutions
            avaliable to date. Although it's beauty sets it apart, it's
            processor based solar controller complements it's elegance.

        <h1>Technology</h1>
          <p>
            Our lights all share a robust, micro-processor based core coupled
            with a Mesh network communications engine allowing simultaneous and
            configurable lighting operation and instantaneous fault
            notification. the processor core harvests all of the available
            solar light using a MPPT charge algorithm and then stores it in a
            LifePo4 batter pack housed within the light pole allowing a
            service live of over 3000+ charge cycles. Out Unique Grid Hybrid
            controller algorithm, when used to upgrade grid based lighting
            will provide peace of mind coupled with the efficiency of solar
            lighting. The controller will run off collected solar energy and
            use the grid for back up during times of poor solar collection to
            provide virtaully 100% up time.
